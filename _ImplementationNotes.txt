---- NOTES ----
If game is using SceneMainLoop, then current tree can be viewed with F1, using arrow keys to navigate around.
F2 will save the current scene (as it is in the current frame) to disk under _data/Scenes/SavedDebugScene.json.
F10 will bring up the debug terminal (using any derived MainLoop)

When overriding SceneNode, be sure to call base.To*()/base.From*() in order to read header data, otherwise node construction will not be complete

InputState contains mouse position as joystick axis 0, axis 1/2 are mouse x/y relative movement (useful for simulating a joystick)
